# Hello World
This is the first entry in the Open Jove Dev Log. I just want to document my process and give room for my ideas. Here are my biggest qualms with the state of Open Jove/Radio Jove.

1. It's not friendly
    1. Radio Jove is a program meant for schools, therefore it has to be easy and simply delight
    2. I think this has to be fixed through design
2. Recording  
    1. Recording has to be more intuative
2. Location Services
    1. This has too be simpler and more effective
    2. The issue is everything relies on third party APIs
3. Viewing has to be intuative
4. The largest issue facing Radio Jove & Open Jove is the scattered file formats. The web expects .wavs for audio, raw data for charts, and nothing aligns
5. The other largest issue will be converting back to .SPD
