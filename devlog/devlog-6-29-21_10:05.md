# Wav, Wav, Wav

I realized that I forgot to write a devlog yesterday, so I'll just catch up now.
Yesterday I wrote a lot of the front end for recording: forms, inputs, etc.
Today I'm working on starting to build the front end. The biggest challenge I'm facing is turning the raw wav file into SPUs (Sky Pipe Units) & Antenna Temprature.
SPU's are relative, so that shouldn't be an issue. But getting calibration may be harder.

For now I'll just work on posting to the back end and getting the data right, but eventually I will have to turn my attention to writing SPDs. Hopefully I'll just be able to reverse engineer my SPD Reading library.
