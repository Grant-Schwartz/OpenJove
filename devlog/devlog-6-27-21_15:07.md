# Conversion Update

I finally fucking figured out how to efficently and correctly convert SPDs out of that stupid format. The issue was really in the channels. Before I was only taking account for 1 channel in the byte search, but now do it based on the number of channels in 8 byte groups.

This solves one of the large problems Dr. Fung pointed out.
